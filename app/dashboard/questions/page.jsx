			answers: [
				"A HashMap uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets, from which the desired value can be found.",
				"Collisions are handled by chaining or open addressing.",
				"Its average time complexity is O(1) for get and put operations.",
				"Internally, keys are hashed and then used to determine where to store values.",
			],

		{
			question: "What is the time complexity of merge sort?",
			answers: [
				"Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases.",
				"It uses a divide-and-conquer strategy.",
				"It’s stable and works well for linked lists.",
				"The merge step takes linear time and dominates the recursion.",

			question: "How would you design a URL shortener like bit.ly?",

				"Use a base62 encoded string as the short key.",
				"Store the mapping in a distributed key-value store like Redis.",
				"Use a counter or hash of the original URL to generate unique keys.",
				"Ensure rate-limiting and analytics features.",

			question: "What are React hooks?",
			answers: [
				"Hooks let you use state and lifecycle features in functional components.",
